# Chicken_Invaders_Game
# Space Shooter Game (Scratch)

## 🎮 Project Overview
This project is a simple 2D shooting game inspired by classic arcade games such as *Chicken Invaders*.  
The game was built using **Scratch** as an early learning project to practice core programming and problem-solving concepts in a visual environment.

The player controls a spaceship and shoots enemies while avoiding collisions.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Scratch (block-based programming)

---

## ✨ Features
- Player movement and controls
- Enemy spawning and movement
- Shooting mechanics
- Sound effects
- Collision detection between bullets and enemies
- Game over condition

---

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Translating game logic into structured steps
- Implementing a basic game loop
- Handling events and interactions
- Designing collision detection logic
- Breaking down a problem into smaller, manageable parts

---

## 🚀 Motivation
This project represents one of my early steps into programming and game logic.  
It helped me build a strong foundation in computational thinking, which I later applied when learning text-based programming languages such as JavaScript, Python, and C.

---

## 📈 Future Improvements
- Rebuilding the game using JavaScript and HTML Canvas
- Adding sound effects and animations
- Implementing increasing difficulty levels
- Improving game UI and feedback
